Two digit sums for kids to practice

A simple Angular and Bootstrap application. Serves as a small project to get familiar with more simple angular concepts using builtin directives, two way data binding and building a simple controller.

Interesting constructs here are usage of 
  - ng-cloak to avoid displaying interpolation during load
  - using element name for form element and a nested button to change its own Name via controller 
  - using the Name of the button to trigger appropriate action via controller in subsequent calls.

For Bootstrap: helps understand bootstrap grid system. Attempts to build a screen (or view) that gives a uniform experience across devices.

Native javascript is used to restrict invalid inputs like characters or spaces. This doesn't seem to work very well on a mobile phone. Math random is used to generate the operands.

Bonus: Helps in teaching kids two digit number sums without carry.
